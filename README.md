# Colour-Based Binary Image Classifier using Genetic Algorithm
Simple classifier based on color histogram. The classifier is basic and use 6 values to classify pictures. These values are found with a genetic algorithm. Only implemented for binary classification. The approach is interesting but the results are bad, especially because we only use color histogram and not other features such as shapes, texture..
